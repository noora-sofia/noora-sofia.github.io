### Hello, I'm Noora.

I'm a lifelong learner with a passion for technology, leadership, and personal growth. This website is my digital gardenâ€”a place where I share my thoughts, experiments, and lessons learned.

My goal is to create a space for curiosity and learning. Whether you're a fellow technologist, a leader looking for new perspectives, or simply someone on a journey of self-improvement, I hope you'll find something valuable here.

### What to Expect

*   **In-depth articles** on software development, and productivity.
*   **Book notes** and summaries of what I'm reading.
*   **Personal reflections** on my journey as a maker and leader.
